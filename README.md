# Large-scale-information-network-embedding-implementation
This project involves the implementation of a scalable information network embedding, with a specific emphasis on first-order proximity. Drawing inspiration from the [LINE (Large-scale Information Network Embedding) paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.03578.pdf), we aim to efficiently capture direct connections between nodes in large-scale information networks. The goal is to generate embeddings that preserve both structural and semantic information within the network.
